# FAST University's Student Portal Using Eclipse

This project leverages the Eclipse Object Constraint Language (OCL) for defining and enforcing business rules and constraints within the system. Flex is a student portal system designed to streamline various academic and administrative processes within a university. 

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Flex portal using the Ecore Modeling Framework in Eclipse, alongside class diagrams and invariant constraints in OCL.

## Class Diagrams
Two class diagrams are provided:
- Ecore Class Diagram: Created from scratch using the Ecore Modeling Framework in Eclipse.
- Lucidchart Class Diagram: Created in Lucidchart

## OCL Invariants
The invariants are provided in two formats:
- Standard OCL Syntax: As taught during the course.
- Eclipse-Compatible OCL Syntax: Adapted to work within the Eclipse environment.

## Additional Features
- Warning System: Manages warnings based on CGPA and enforces rules on course registration under warning conditions.
- Financial Assistance: Handles loan eligibility, renewal criteria, and repayment terms based on student performance.
- Fee Management: Details fee due dates, payment methods, and refund policies.
- Scholarships: Defines eligibility for merit-based scholarships and maintains CGPA requirements for scholarship continuation.
